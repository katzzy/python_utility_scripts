# python_utility_scripts

This repository, named python_utility_scripts, contains Python scripts for handling common tasks.

For instance, `modify_line_endings.py` is a script that modifies the line endings of all files in a folder and its subfolders from LF (Linux style) to CRLF (Windows style) to avoid git warnings when committing files with LF line endings.

To use these scripts, simply run the corresponding Python file and provide the necessary arguments as instructed in the file.
