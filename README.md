# python_utility_scripts

This repository contains Python scripts for handling common tasks.

`modify_line_endings.py` is a script that modifies the line endings of all files in a folder and its subfolders from LF (Linux style) to CRLF (Windows style) to avoid git warnings when committing files with LF line endings.

`minimize_size_of_dataset.py` is a script that deletes a specified percentage of files from each folder in a directory to minimize the size of the dataset for testing purposes

To use these scripts, simply run the corresponding Python file and provide the necessary arguments as instructed in the file.
